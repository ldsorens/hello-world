# hello-world
I am a student at Utica College, which is located in Utica, New York.
As an Army Retiree I am entering the programming path a little later than most, but I am fully confident that I will screw up more than my fair share of code as I am learning!
Just remind myself of the age old question...How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time, in our case, one byte at a time.
